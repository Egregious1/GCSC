Ethical Concepts that Guide Cybersecurity Decisions

Ethical Concerns and laws related to counterattacks:

United States standpoint on counterattacks - 
    In the us, deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, among others. You can only defend. The act of counterattacking in the US is perceived as an act of vigilantism. Threat actors are criminal, counterattacks can lead to further escalation of the attack, which can cause even more damage and harm. 
    
    If the threat actor in question is a state-sponsored hacktivist, a counterattack can lead to serious international implications.

    A hacktivist is a person who uses hacking to achieve a political goal. The political goal may be to promote social change or civil disobedience.

    For these reasons, the only individuals in the US who are allowed to counterattack are approved employees of the federal government or military personnel.
