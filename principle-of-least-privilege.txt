Principle of least privilege

Security controls are essential to keeping sensitive data private and safe. One of the most common controls is the principle of least privilege, also referred to as PoLP or least privilege. The PoLP is a security concept in which a user is only granted the minimum level of acces and authorization required to complete a task or function.

Least privilege is a fundemental security control that supports the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad of information. In this reading, you will learn how the principle of least privilege reduces risk, How it's commonly implemented, and why it should be routinely audited.

Limiting access reduces risk

every business needs to plan for the risk of data theft, misuse, or abuse. Implementing the principle of least privilege can greatly reduce the risk of costly incidents like data breaches by:

     * Limiting access to sensitive information
     *Reducing the chances of accidental data modification, tampering, or loss
     *Supporting system monitoring and administration

least privilege greatly reduces the likelyhood of a successful attack by connecting specific resources to specific users and placing limits on what they can do. It's important security control that should be applied to any asset. Clearly defining who or what your users are is usually the first step of implementing least privilege effectively.

Note: least privilege is closely related to another fundimental security principle, the separation of duties - a security concept that divides tasks and responsibilitys among different users to prevent giving a single user complete control over critical business functions.

Determining access and authorization

To implement least privilege, access, and authorization must be determined first. There are two questions to ask to so:

   * Who is the user?
   * How much access do they need to a specific resource?

Determining who is the user is usually straightforward. A user can reger to a person, like a customer, employee, or a vendor. It can also refer to a device or software that's connected to your business network. In general, every user should have their own account. Accounts are typically stored and managed within an organization's directory service.

These are the most common types of user accounts:

      * Guest accounts - are provided to external users who need to access an internal network, like customers, clients, contractors, or business partners
      * User accounts - are assigned to stagg based on their job duties
      * Service accounts - Granted to applications or software that needs to interact with other software on the network.
      * Privileged accounts - have elevated permissions or administrative access.

Pro tip: passwords play an important role when implementing the PoLP. Even if user accounts are assigned appropriately, an insecure password can compromis your systems.

Auditing account privileges

Setting up the right user accounts and assigning them the appropritate privileges is a helpful first step. Periodically auditing those accounts is a key part of keeping your company's systems secure.

There are three common approaches to auditing user accounts :

      * Usage audits
      * Privilege audits
      * Account change audits

as a security professional, you might be involved with any of these processes.

Usage audits

When conducting a usage audit, the security team will review which resources each account is accessing and what the user is doing with the resources. Usage audits can help determine whether users are acting in accordance with an organization's security policies. They can also help identify whether a user has permissions that be revoked because they are no longer being used.

Privilege audits

Users tend to accumulate more access privileges than they need over time, an issue known as privilege creep. This might occur in an employee receives a promotion or swithces teams and their job duties change. Privilege audits assess whether a user's role is in alignment with the resources they have access to.

Account change audits

Account directory services keep records and logs associated with each user. Changes to an account are usually saved and can be used to audit the directory for suspicious activity, like multiple attemplts to change an account password. Preforming account change audits helps to ensure that all account changes are made by authorized users.

Note: Most directory services can be configured to alery system administrators of suspicious activity.

Key takeaways

The PoLP is a security control that can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information and resources. Setting up and configuring user accounts with the right levels of access and authorization is an important step toward implementing least privilege. Auditing user accounts and revoking unnecessary access rights is an important practive that helps maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
